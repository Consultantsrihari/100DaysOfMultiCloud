# Day 04 — Images

This folder contains suggested diagrams and thumbnail images for Day 4 (VPC & VNet) content.  Use these images in video slides, blog posts, and README.

Suggested image list:
- `day4-vpc-vnet-architecture.svg` - Visual architecture of VPC/VNet with public/private subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway and route table visuals.
- `day4-hub-spoke.svg` - Hub and Spoke architecture with hub VPC/VNet and multiple spokes, transit gateway/virtual WAN.
- `day4-nat-flow.svg` - Diagram showing packet flow from private instance -> NAT Gateway -> Internet, plus return path.
- `day4-sg-nsg-diff.svg` - Diagram comparing AWS Security Groups vs Azure NSGs and NACLs (scope and stateful/stateless).
- `thumbnail-part1-theory.svg` - Thumbnail for Theory video/slide
- `thumbnail-part2-hands-on.svg` - Thumbnail for Hands-On video/slide

Tips
- Export the final diagrams as SVG first, then PNG at 1280x720 for thumbnails.
- Keep diagrams simple and consistent—single color palette and strong labels.
- Use the diagram and flow for the video timing (slide references: Part 1 -> diagrams, Part 2 -> hands-on architecture)

Note: These are placeholder files — replace with polished diagrams created in the tool of your choice (Figma, Draw.io/diagrams.net, Visio, etc.).
