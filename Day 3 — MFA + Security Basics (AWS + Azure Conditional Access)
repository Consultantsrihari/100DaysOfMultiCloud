## 📘 Overview

Welcome to **Day 3** of the **100 Days of Multi-Cloud Series**!  
In this project, we’ll explore **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** in **AWS** and **Conditional Access** in **Azure** — two of the most critical layers in cloud identity and access security.

By the end of this session, you’ll:
- Understand **what MFA is** and **why it’s essential**
- Configure **MFA in AWS IAM**
- Set up **Conditional Access policies in Azure Entra ID**
- Compare how both platforms protect cloud identities

## 🧠 Theory — MFA & Conditional Access Explained

### ⭐ What is MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)?
**MFA** adds a second verification layer during login, ensuring that even if your password is stolen, attackers can’t access your account.

**Example:**
1️⃣ Enter password  
2️⃣ Confirm login using your phone or Authenticator app  

💡 MFA reduces identity-based attacks by **over 99%**.

---

### 🔐 Types of MFA
- **OTP (One-Time Password)**  
- **Authenticator App** (Google / Microsoft Authenticator)  
- **SMS Code**  
- **Hardware Key (YubiKey)**  
- **Biometric (Fingerprint / Face ID)**

---

### 🧩 Why MFA Matters
- Protects against **phishing**  
- Prevents **credential stuffing**  
- Reduces **social engineering risk**  
- Secures **remote logins**

## ☁️ Azure Conditional Access (Smart MFA)

**Conditional Access** = “MFA + intelligent rules.”

It lets organizations apply **conditional logic** for authentication — determining who can access, from where, on which device, and under what conditions.

**Azure checks conditions such as:**
- User or group
- Location (geo/IP)
- Device compliance
- Risk level
- Application type

**Then applies actions:**
- Allow  
- Block  
- Require MFA  
- Require compliant device  

💬 Azure’s Conditional Access = Smart, dynamic MFA for enterprises.
